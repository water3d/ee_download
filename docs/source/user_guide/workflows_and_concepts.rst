Workflows and Concepts
=========================

The EEDLImage Class
----------------------


Task Registries
--------------------

.. note::
    In the long run, we'd like to remove the concept of the Task Registry in favor of truly
    asynchronous code that runs in the background. In the meantime, they remain an important concept
    in EEDL that is mostly transparent for your use.


Tuning Default Values for Exports
------------------------------------


Exporting a Single ee.Image
------------------------------


Exporting a Filtered ee.ImageCollection
------------------------------------------
